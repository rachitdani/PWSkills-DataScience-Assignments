    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information about how much the data points deviate from the central tendency measures (mean, median, or mode) and how spread out the values are within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range:\n",
    "- Definition: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "- Use: The range gives an idea of the spread of the data from the lowest to the highest value.\n",
    "- Example: Consider the following dataset of test scores: [70, 75, 80, 85, 90]. The range is calculated as 90 (maximum value) - 70 (minimum value) = 20. This means the spread of the test scores in the dataset is 20 points.\n",
    "2. Variance:\n",
    "- Definition: Variance is a measure of how far the data points are spread out from the mean. It quantifies the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "- Use: Variance provides an overall measure of dispersion, considering all data points.\n",
    "- Calculation: The variance is computed by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean, dividing it by the total number of data points (or n-1 for sample variance due to bessels correction to remove bias).\n",
    "- Example: Continuing with the test scores dataset, let's assume the mean of the scores is 80. The variance would be calculated as [(70-80)^2 + (75-80)^2 + (80-80)^2 + (85-80)^2 + (90-80)^2] / 5 = 100. The variance of 100 indicates that the test scores have considerable variability from the mean score of 80.\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation:\n",
    "- Definition: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is used to describe the typical amount of deviation or dispersion of data points from the mean.\n",
    "- Use: Standard deviation provides a measure of the spread of data in the original units of measurement, making it easier to interpret and compare to the mean.\n",
    "- Calculation: The standard deviation is computed by taking the square root of the variance.\n",
    "- Example: In the test scores dataset, the standard deviation would be the square root of the variance, which is √100 = 10. This indicates that the typical deviation of the test scores from the mean of 80 is 10 points."

    "For a normal distribution, the three measures of central tendency, namely the mean, median, and mode, are all equal to each other.

    "The relationship between the measures of central tendency in a normal distribution is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean of a normal distribution is located at the center of the distribution, and it is equal to the median and the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median of a normal distribution is also located at the center of the distribution, and it is equal to the mean and the mode.\n",

    "Mode: The mode of a normal distribution is the peak point of the curve, and it is equal to both the mean and the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equality between the mean, median, and mode in a normal distribution is a characteristic of its symmetry. The symmetrical shape of the normal distribution curve is bell-shaped, and half of the data lies on either side of the mean, resulting in the median being the same as the mean and mode."

    "### Covariance:\n",
    "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It indicates whether the variables increase or decrease simultaneously. A positive covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. Conversely, a negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.

    "\n",

    "### Correlation:\n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure that provides the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It normalizes the covariance by dividing it by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables, resulting in a value between -1 and +1. A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
